                <p className='p-3'>My name is Alex McRandall and I am a Full Stack Web Developer.  I have ten years of government experience and most recently I graduated from a full stack web development bootcamp at the University of California, Berkeley in August 2019. </p>
                <p className='p-3'>Over the past four years, I have taught myself full stack web development and have experience with Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, relational (MySQL) and non-relational databases (MongoDB), Git/GitHub, among other skills.  I have experience in React.js and RESTful APIs and have incorporated them into many of my applications found on my <a href='https://aljoker2001.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/'>GitHub profile</a>.</p>
                <p className='p-3'>I am passionate about development, solving difficult problems, and learning new technologies.  The satisfaction that comes with fixing errors, debugging, and learning from experience is hard to beat.</p>

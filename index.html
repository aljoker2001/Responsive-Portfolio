            <p class="bio">I would have to say that I have a pretty wonderful life. I have an amazing wife, two dogs who
                aren't
                always annoying and a cat who is only slightly more annoying. My
                friends and family are fantastic and extremely supportive.</p>
            <p class="bio">My hobbies include, but are not limited to - reading, video games, astronomy, programming
                (obviously, I'm
                a beginner but I've been practicing), and collecting swords, which I realize sounds a little serial
                killer-y, but I promise it's not really that weird. As far as the programming goes, I've been studying
                various languages: Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and I dipped my toe in some data analytics until
                I realized how over my head I was.</p>
            <p class="bio">I am very excited to be taking this boot camp. I believe it will help me set myself up for a
                new career
                in software development. While I realize this is a web development course, I envision my first job in
                web development to be a stepping stone while I continue to learn and build my skillset. I will continue
                to learn and grow and hope to find my dream job either developing software for a video game company or
                for a company involved in space exploration.</p>
